## Overview

### The Challenge

Discover your next career move with the Static Job Listings website. Browse through a curated list of job opportunities and find the perfect fit for your skills and aspirations.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

- Live Site URL: [Live Site](https://job-listing-frontend.netlify.app/)

## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I Learned

- Designing an intuitive user interface for job seekers to easily find relevant job listings
- Implementing interactive features for filtering and searching job listings based on various criteria
- Creating a responsive layout for seamless browsing across devices

```js
class JobBoard {
  constructor() {
    this.mainContainer = document.querySelector(".main-container");
    this.dataBox = document.querySelector(".data-box");
    this.dataBoxStored = document.querySelector(".data-stored-box");
    this.clear = document.querySelector(".clear-data");
    this.clear.addEventListener("click", this.clearData.bind(this));
    this.mainContainer.addEventListener("click", this.selectButton.bind(this));
    this.dataBox.addEventListener("click", this.deleteDataStorage.bind(this));
    this.dataStored = [];
    this.newData = null;
    this.fetchData();
  }

  fetchData() {
    fetch("./data.json")
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((data) => {
        this.newData = data;
        this.renderData(this.newData);
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error("Error fetching JSON file:", error);
      });
  }
```

### Continued development

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in javascript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.
